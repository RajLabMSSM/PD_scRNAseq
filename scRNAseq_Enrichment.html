<h2>Enrichr on WGCNA Modules</h2>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: Bulk RNA-seq was conducted on monocytes extracted from the blood of controls and PD patients. Katia Lopes conducted Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) on these sameples and identified co-expression modules.</li>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: Determine whether any of these modules are representative of cell groups in our scRNA-seq monocytes data.</li>
